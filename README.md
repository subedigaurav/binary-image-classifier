# imageClassifier
**imageClassifier** is a simple Image Classifier. It is built using [Keras](https://keras.io/) on top of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the model, you will need to install Tensorflow and Keras.
1. **Tensorflow**
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow
    ```
    Official document for Tensorflow installation can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
    
2. **Keras**
    ```bash
    pip install keras
    ```
    Official document for Keras installation can be found [here](https://keras.io/#installation)

3. **Dataset** <br />
    The dataset folder consists of two sub-folders: *cat* and *dog*. These will be the classes for the classifier. I have included about 4000 images for cats and dogs (2000 each).
    You are free to use the sample classes. <br />
    **OR** <br />
    Create sub-folders inside the **dataset** folder as per your requirements and add the images there.
