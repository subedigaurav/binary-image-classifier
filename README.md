# imageClassifier
**imageClassifier** is a simple Image Classifier. It is built using [Keras](https://keras.io/) on top of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the model, you will need to install Tensorflow and Keras.
1. **Tensorflow**
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow
    ```
    Official document for Tensorflow installation can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
    
2. **Keras**
    ```bash
    pip install keras
    ```
    Official document for Keras installation can be found [here](https://keras.io/#installation)
    
Add Folders as per the classes inside the dataset directory. Then, train the classifier using the file 'classifier.py'
